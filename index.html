     <h1>Akan NAMING SYSTEM</h1>
   </div>
   <p>The <strong>Akan people</strong> of <strong>Ghana</strong> frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.<br> These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.<br> Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.<br>Diverse ethnicities have variants and meanings as a symbol of cultural integrity and ancestral affiliation. </p>
